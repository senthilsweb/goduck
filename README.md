# goduck

Goduck is a dynamic REST API project inspired by Postgrest, designed to provide you with a seamless interaction with DuckDB, a high-performance analytical database. This documentation offers an overview of the project, its technical design features, environment setup instructions, and practical examples of endpoint usage.

## Introduction

Goduck simplifies your interaction with DuckDB by exposing a RESTful API that dynamically handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on database tables. It draws inspiration from Postgrest, offering a user-friendly experience to interact with your DuckDB database using simple HTTP requests.

## Technical Design Features

Goduck boasts the following key technical design features:

- **Dynamic Entity Handling:** Goduck supports interaction with multiple entities (tables) within the DuckDB database without needing manual configuration for each entity.

- **Flexible Filtering and Sorting:** Utilize query parameters to dynamically filter and sort data, enabling complex queries without explicitly writing SQL statements.

- **Pagination Support:** Control the number of returned records and their starting point using the `limit` and `offset` query parameters.

- **ActiveRecord Pattern:** Goduck encourages the use of the ActiveRecord pattern, providing a seamless way to perform database operations using struct-like objects.

## Environment Setup

Before you run Goduck and interact with your DuckDB database, follow these steps:

1. **Install DuckDB:** Install DuckDB on your system. You can download it from the official DuckDB repository.

2. **Create DuckDB Database:** Use the provided Makefile to create a DuckDB database named `data.db`. This database will store your project data.

   ```sh
   make create-db
   ```

3. **Create Sequence Table:** Run the following SQL query to create a sequence table that will manage IDs for different entities.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE id_sequence (entity_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, next_id INT);
   ```

4. **Run the Application:** Once the environment is set up, run the Goduck application using `go run app.go`. The REST API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Example: Bugs Entity

For demonstration purposes, let's consider a table named "bugs" with the following columns:

- `id`: ID of the bug (auto-generated)
- `created_at`: Timestamp of bug creation
- `modified_at`: Timestamp of last modification
- `update_count`: Count of updates
- `title`: Title of the bug
- `description`: Description of the bug
- `status`: Current status of the bug

### Demo Data

Here's an example of synthetic data for a bug:

```json
{
    "created_at": "2023-08-29T21:03:23.545206Z",
    "description": "This is a sample bug description.",
    "id": 1,
    "modified_at": "2023-08-29T21:18:31.477748Z",
    "status": "Closed",
    "title": "Sample Bug Title",
    "update_count": 2
}
```

### Example Endpoints

1. **Create Bug:**

   ```http
   POST http://localhost:8080/bugs
   ```

   Send a JSON payload to create a new bug.

2. **Get Bugs:**

   ```http
   GET http://localhost:8080/bugs?limit=10&offset=0&select=title,description&status.eq=Open&title.like=Sample%&order=created_at.desc
   ```

   Retrieve bugs based on filters, sorting, and pagination. In this example, bugs are sorted by `created_at` in descending order.

3. **Update Bug:**

   ```http
   PUT http://localhost:8080/bugs/1
   ```

   Send a JSON payload to update a bug by ID.

4. **Delete Bug:**

   ```http
   DELETE http://localhost:8080/bugs/1
   ```

   Delete a bug by ID.

## ActiveRecord Pattern

Goduck encourages the use of the ActiveRecord pattern, where entities are represented as struct-like objects. This pattern simplifies database interactions by allowing you to create, update, and query entities in a more intuitive way. Check the Goduck codebase and examples for guidance on utilizing the ActiveRecord pattern effectively.
